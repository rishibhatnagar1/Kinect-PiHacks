# Kinect-PiHacks

This place is going to be the idea dumpyard for now Ideas:
1. Kinect measures gestures which control the orientation of a suspended structure. It will be like magic, so emulate those japanese cartoon series thing superhero actions using Kinect.

2. Track the head bobbing and according to it control the beats of music.

3. Measure the movement of the shoulders to determine the kind of music that should be played.

4. Kinect + Google Cardboard, make people see things that are controlled by their gestures.

5. Emulate a prosthetic hand for the people who are missing it by creating a replica of their other hand.

6. Emulate how it could feel to freely move around for people who are wheelchair ridden.
